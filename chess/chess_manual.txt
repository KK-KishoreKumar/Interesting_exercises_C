Chess moves:
# BASIC PIECE MOVEMENT:
- KING: moves one square in any direction. 
The king also has a special move called castling that involves also moving a rook.

- ROOK: can move any number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces. 
Along with the king, a rook is involved during the king's castling move.

- BISHOP: can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot leap over other pieces.

- QUEEN: The queen combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank, 
file, or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces.

- KNIGHT: The knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal, thus the move forms an "L"-shape: 
two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically. 
The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.

- PAWN: The pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first 
move it can advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied; 
or the pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, by moving to that square. 
A pawn has two special moves: the en passant capture and promotion

## SPECIAL MOVES:

1) CASTLING : 
Once in every game, each king is allowed to make a special move, known as castling. 
Castling consists of moving the king two squares along the first rank toward a rook (which is on the player's first rank) 
and then placing the rook on the last square that the king has just crossed. 
Castling is permissible under the following conditions:
- Neither the king nor the rook have previously moved during the game.
- There cannot be any pieces between the king and the rook.
- The king cannot be in check, nor can the king pass through squares that are under attack by enemy pieces, 
or move to a square where it would result in a check. 
Note that castling is permissible if the rook is attacked, or if the rook crosses a square that is attacked.

2) EN PASSANT:
When a pawn advances two squares from its starting position and there is an opponent's pawn on an adjacent file next 
to its destination square, then the opponent's pawn can capture it en passant (in passing), and move to the square the 
pawn passed over. This can only be done on the very next move, otherwise the right to do so is forfeit. 
For example, if the black pawn has just advanced two squares from g7 (initial starting position) to g5,
then the white pawn on f5 may take it via en passant on g6 (but only on White's next move).

3) PROMOTION:
When a pawn advances to the eighth rank, as a part of the move it is promoted and must be exchanged for the player's choice 
of queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. Usually, the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen, 
but in some cases another piece is chosen; this is called underpromotion. 

4) CHECK:
When a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. 
A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). 
This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only 
if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. 
Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, 
and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave the player's own king in check
